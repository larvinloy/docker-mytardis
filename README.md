Dockerized MyTardis
===================

This is a dockerized build of the 3.7 branch of the Mytardis Data Curation system: http://mytardis.org

Creates an assembly of docker containers that provide the mytardis webportal, persistent tardis store and mysql/postgres db,  rabbitmq message broker, two celery workers, and celery monitoring interface, ELK logging,  all working on a single host.

The build has three types of configurations
- **postgres**: Uses PostgreSQL db; users are managed via local Django user management only
- **mysql**: Uses MySQL db; users are managed via local Django user management only
- **cas**: Uses MySQL db, users are managed via local Django user management and Central Authentication Service (CAS)

This branch integrates the mytardisbf filter package(https://github.com/keithschulze/mytardisbf), which uses Bioformats library to preview images and extract metadata. For more information read ```REPORT.pdf.```

Usage
-----
1. Install latest version of docker-engine and docker-compose (http://docs.docker.com/compose)

2. Clone `docker-mytardis` repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ianedwardthomas/docker-mytardis.git
```

3. Configure the mytardis build. The build can be configured as *postgres* (recommended), *mysql*, or *cas*. The following configures the build to use PostgreSQL.
```
    - cd docker-mytardis
    - ./init postgres
```

4. Copy the default environment variables:
```
    cp env .env
```
  and change passwords in ```.env```.

5. Start the system in either of the following ways:
  
  - To start the system from existing images of MyTardis and related components  using self-signed certificate (Recommended): 
```
    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose run makecerts
    docker-compose up -d
```
 - To start the system after building new images of MyTardis and related components using self-signed certificate (only if you intend to make changes to the `docker-mytardis` codebase):
```
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose run makecerts
    docker-compose up -d
```
  After a while, the location http://127.0.0.1 will point at the mytardis portal. To watch the celery workers go to: http://127.0.0.1:5555.

6. To create a root user:
```  
  docker exec -ti dockermytardis_app_1 python /opt/mytardis/webapp/mytardis.py createsuperuser --user=root
```

7. Modify the settings file to enable filter
```
  docker exec app bash
  cd tardis
  nano settings.py
```
   Uncomment all lines between ```added``` and ```added-end```
  
8. Exit container and refresh
```
  docker-compose up -d
```

The ```nginx_conf``` directory has information for setup of the kibana log visualiser

This project is working reasonably well as demo, but IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE
